*Locating a robotic car using particle filter


 The robot travels in a "world" that has 4 landmarks.
 
 landmarks  = [[0.0, 100.0], [0.0, 0.0], [100.0, 0.0], [100.0, 100.0]]

 The robot's initial coordinates are somewhere in the square represented by the landmarks.

 World is NOT cyclic. Robot is allowed to travel "out of bounds".

 The robot can move, and sense its own location by measuring its bearings to the landmarks.
 However, in the real world, there are considerable noises with both move and sense functions.

 The GOAL is to locate the car (position and orientation) within specified tolerances at least 80% of the time.

 tolerance_xy = 15.0 # Tolerance for localization in the x and y directions.
 tolerance_orientation = 0.25 # Tolerance for orientation.
